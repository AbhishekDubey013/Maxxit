# ü§ñ Telegram Webhook Issue - Using Old Production Code

## üîç **The Real Problem:**

Your Telegram bot webhook is pointing to **Vercel production**, not localhost!

```
Telegram Bot ‚Üí Vercel (maxxit1.vercel.app) ‚Üí OLD CODE with V2 module ‚ùå
               NOT ‚Üí localhost:5000 ‚Üí NEW CODE with V3 module
```

---

## ‚úÖ **Solution Options:**

### **Option 1: Wait for Vercel Deployment** (Easiest)

The fixes are pushed to GitHub. Vercel should auto-deploy them.

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/your-project
2. Check if deployment is in progress
3. Wait for it to complete (~2-3 minutes)
4. Try Telegram command again

---

### **Option 2: Force Vercel Redeploy**

If auto-deploy didn't trigger:

1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Deployments"
3. Find latest commit
4. Click "Redeploy"
5. Wait for completion
6. Try Telegram command

---

### **Option 3: Point Telegram to Localhost** (For Testing)

**Only if you want to test locally:**

1. Use ngrok to expose localhost:
   ```bash
   npx ngrok http 5000
   ```

2. Get the ngrok URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)

3. Update Telegram webhook:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/telegram/webhook"
   ```

4. Test Telegram command
5. **Remember to set it back to production after testing!**

## üéØ **Recommended: Just Wait for Vercel**

Since I already pushed all fixes to GitHub:
- ‚úÖ Database updates
- ‚úÖ Hardcoded V2 fallbacks ‚Üí V3
- ‚úÖ All 14 deployments updated

**Vercel should deploy these automatically within 2-3 minutes.**

---

## üìä **Check Vercel Deployment Status:**

```bash
# If you have Vercel CLI:
vercel ls

# Or just visit:
https://vercel.com/your-username/maxxit/deployments
```

Look for the latest commit: `"fix: remove all hardcoded V2 module fallbacks"`

---

## üß™ **After Vercel Deploys:**

Try Telegram command:
```
"Buy 2 USDC of WETH"
```

Should work immediately! ‚úÖ

## üí° **Why Localhost Changes Don't Affect Telegram:**

```
Your Telegram Bot Config:
webhook_url: "https://maxxit1.vercel.app/api/telegram/webhook"
                         ‚Üë
                   Production server
                   (not localhost!)
```

That's why restarting localhost server doesn't help - Telegram never hits it!
