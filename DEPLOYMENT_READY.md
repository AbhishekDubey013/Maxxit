## 🚀 Deploy in 3 Steps (< 10 minutes)

### **Step 1: Setup Database (2 min)**

**Go to:** https://neon.tech

1. Sign up with GitHub
2. Create project: "Maxxit"
3. Copy connection string
4. Save it!

---

### **Step 2: Deploy to Vercel (5 min)**

**Option A: One Command** (Recommended)

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

That's it! The script will:
- Install Vercel CLI
- Login to Vercel
- Deploy your app
- Give you a production URL

**Option B: Manual Steps**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

---

### **Step 3: Add Environment Variables (3 min)**

After deployment:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add these:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... (from Neon)
X_BEARER_TOKEN=your_token
GAME_API_KEY=your_key
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_key
EXECUTOR_PRIVATE_KEY=your_key
MODULE_ADDRESS=0xa87f82433294cE8A3C8f08Ec5D2825e946C0c0FE
PLATFORM_FEE_RECEIVER=your_address
SEPOLIA_RPC=https://ethereum-sepolia.publicnode.com
ARBITRUM_RPC=https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
BASE_RPC=https://mainnet.base.org
```

5. Redeploy: `vercel --prod`

---

## ✅ That's It!

Your app will be live at: `https://your-project.vercel.app`

---

## 📊 What Works After Deployment

### ✅ Immediate (No extra setup)
- Agent creation UI
- Landing page
- API endpoints
- Database operations
- Safe wallet integration
- Performance dashboard

### ⏳ Needs Workers Running
- Automated signal generation
- Automated trade execution
- Automated position monitoring

**Note:** Workers are already running on your local machine! They'll continue to work with your production database.

---

## 🔧 Post-Deployment

### Test Your Production Site

```bash
# Visit your site
open https://your-project.vercel.app

# Test API
curl https://your-project.vercel.app/api/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok"}
```

### Setup Database

```bash
# Run migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Seed data (tokens, venues)
npx tsx scripts/seed.ts
```

### Monitor

- **Vercel Dashboard:** Real-time traffic & errors
- **Neon Dashboard:** Database queries & performance
- **Workers:** Already running (check: `bash workers/status-workers.sh`)

---

## 🎯 Optional: Deploy Workers to Cloud

If you want workers in the cloud too:

### Railway (Easiest)

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. New Project → Deploy from GitHub
4. Add environment variables
5. Start command: `bash workers/start-workers.sh`

### VPS (DigitalOcean, AWS, etc)

```bash
# SSH to server
ssh user@your-server.com

# Clone & setup
git clone your-repo
cd maxxit
npm install

# Start workers
bash workers/start-workers.sh

# Setup systemd for auto-restart
# See PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md
```
