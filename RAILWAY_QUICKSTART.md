```

Check balance:
```bash

```

When you update Prisma schema:
```bash
# 1. Create migration locally
npx prisma migrate dev --name your_change

# 2. Commit and push
git add prisma/migrations
git commit -m "db: your change"
git push

# 3. Railway auto-applies migrations
```

- Check Twitter API service is running
- Check CT accounts are configured
