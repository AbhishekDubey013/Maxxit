## 🐛 Known Issues:

1. **Contract Bug (Fixed in code, needs redeploy):**
   - Current: User needs `amountIn + 0.2 USDC` available
   - Fixed: User only needs `amountIn` (fee deducted from trade)
   - Impact: Low (workaround is to trade smaller amounts)

2. **Executor Gas:**
   - Current balance: 0.00586 ETH (~346 trades remaining)
   - Recommend: Top up to 0.1 ETH for production
