git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: force railway redeploy - clear cache

Railway appears to be running old code despite having latest commits.
This empty commit forces a full rebuild and restart.

Latest fixes that MUST be loaded:
- db7943e: Disable fixed stop loss
- 1929c29: Enable trailing stop on all positions
- e7450ff: 1% trailing stop + price oracle fixes

After this deploys, positions should:
‚úÖ Stay open until +3% profit
‚úÖ Exit only via 1% trailing stop
‚ùå NOT close on -10% drops"
